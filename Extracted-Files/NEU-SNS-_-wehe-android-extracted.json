Rarely if ever updated. But everyone should know about this app, much like Ookla Speedtest. If they did, maybe mobile companies wouldn't throttle so indiscriminately and dishonestly. Would be very useful if the app was updated to detect 0 or extremely poor connections. Under those conditions, it either doesn't work or seems not to work.",
