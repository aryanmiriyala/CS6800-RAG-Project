                "content": "Excellent minimalist app that does just the basic metronome with visual indicator, optional emphasis on first beat, settable subdivisions for more nuanced beats, and BPM with fine grained and course grained selectors plus tap pattern. Default sound for the click has just enough kick to be heard without disturbing people in adjacent room. This works great for my needs as a cello player learning classical music and traditional Celtic tunes.",
