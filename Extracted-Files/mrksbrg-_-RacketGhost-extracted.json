                "content": "Really good ghosting app. Has all the usual settings (time between shots, shots in set, number of sets, rest between sets, etc). However some things stand out... First it doesn't use a stupid numbering system. No idea why most ghosting apps number the corners, that just adds delay as your brain has to remember which one is \"5\"! This uses front/volley/back left/right. Secondly the sounds are cleverly panned so the left commands are panned left and right to the right. Once you realise this, it's so useful! Finally it sensibly gives you less time for the mid-court volleys, which makes sense as they're much closer to the T. Excellent app, way better than any other ghosting app I've tried (and that included paid ones!). Top stuff!",
