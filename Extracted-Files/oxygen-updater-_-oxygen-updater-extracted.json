Now it keeps showing me 12 Beta for my Nord while my advance setting is off and selection is stable / incremental. ------------------------ Updated: Okay thanks, understand 12 is now general release so this is all good. Having said that, till a few days back it was suggesting I update to 11.1.10.10.AC01DA (full version) when I already am on the same version updated via OTA. So that is why I got confused when it suggested AC2001_11_F.11 .",

EDIT: responding to dev, I don't think you read that I'm on a custom ROM - I don't want to update, I just want to get the full update file to extract the firmware and flash it manually myself in fastboot. I already did - it's just confusing and constantly tells you stuff to make you think it isn't possible. Maybe you could reword the unsupported dialog",
