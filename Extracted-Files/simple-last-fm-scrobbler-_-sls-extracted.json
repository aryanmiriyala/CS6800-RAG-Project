I use Simple Scrobbler on both my phone and mp3 player and it still works just fine. I've never lost any scrobbles. My one nitpick is that sometimes a new album is created when Song Artist =/= Album Artist, but I think this has more to do with the music player I'm using than this app itself. The problem occurs on my Walkman mp3 player but not on my phone with Rocket Player.",

                "content": "I've been using this app reliably for YEARS, but after updating to the latest version, with all its weird changes, nothing works anymore. I don't know how many of these changes were forced by the recent Google Play app policy changes, but something needs to be done, because it is dreadfully bad, useless, buggy, and misleading now. All lifetime scrobble stats are gone, the account was signed out, nothing gets scrobbled, and no scrobbles remain in the cache to even get properly scrobbled at one point after they failed to be saved to my account. The most I get is a song put out to Last.fm as 'Now Playing' but that's it. After the song finishes playing, it doesn't stay scrobbled, but just changes the song listed as Now Playing. This is a major problem. The app doesn't work at all anymore and I've missed a ton of scrobbles because of this. I feel bad for all those who auto update their apps and don't even realize their plays aren't being scrobbled anymore, can't imagine how many scrobbled were lost from this. The logo change is a welcome update and a notable improvement, and the themes are good even though they are tedious to enable and compare. Plus there's all the weird behavior with the new sticky notification dropdown entry which is totally useless, and the weird permissions it requires now. I'm sideloading an older version I had backed up for the foreseeable future, and so far it works flawlessly. Responding for the dev: I had already tried experimenting with various scenarios and they all resulted in the same broken state.

I have changed all the settings, logged out and back in, but it won't scrobble anything..   Edit: seems like it's a conflict with the screen overlay. I turned off all my overlay apps like Twilight and still wouldn't work. I had to force stop Twilight, reinstall Simple and set its permissions in order to get Simple to work. Then I re-engage Twilight. We'll see if it works...   Edit 2: when I set the permissions with no overlays, it worked. However I turned on Messenger overlays to use the chat heads and suddenly simple last.fm stopped scrobbling completely. It's not even recognizing that songs are being played, let alone sending them. There goes four hours of scrobbles, gone, as no indication of the app failing was given. I cleared the scrobbler data, disabled all overlays, and restarted the app but it STILL doesn't work. I think this is a serious issue and needs to be addressed, as it is pretty much app-breaking. I can no longer recommend this app unless this issue is fixed",
