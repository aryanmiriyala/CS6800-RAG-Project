                "content": "Excellent and very useful app.  Works perfectly.  I especially like that you can specify which of your phone's apps VN will speak for.   Suggestions/comments: 1) Would be nice if it could also say caller's names.   2) And if the widget changed colour (and shape?) when VN is turned off. ...p.s. Just realised it does seem to change colour but for those of us who are colour-blind, we need a much clearer change please.  ...maybe from primary red or yellow when \"on\" to greyed out when \"off\".  Thanks. 2) YouTube alerts don't seem to be read although YouTube is set to \"not ignored\". 3) It would be nice to display \"Run VN yes/no?\" on power-up.  It's a bit disconcerting to hear it suddenly start talking when you turn your phone on as you leave the cinema.",
