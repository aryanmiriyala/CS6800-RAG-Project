This is a big boost compared to other cloud-based third-party tools. (I use Syncthing to synchronize my Zotero collection, with some 2000 PDF files, between my PC and an e-ink tablet. Despite the slow download speed logged on the e-ink table, a single file change gets synced within 10 seconds or so. This is very much usable for going paperless.) Previously, per my testing with FolderSync Pro, it was not clear to me until I email the author that FolderSync was checking one thing at a time, and one folder-pair at a time. This process can take up to 5 minutes for a folder with 4000 files. For the poor e-ink tablet, it has logged some 30 minutes wait time for syncing a single file-change. I am now gladly settled with the Syncthing setup. Cheers and Kudos!",

Pros: Free and Open Source decentralized file syncing, robust platform support, functional UI, respect for privacy, good feature set, and it usually works. Cons: It's difficult to get set up, the phone app can burn through a lot of battery life, and it can have a delete scare or two with treating a half-synced version as the master copy. After some learning and some caution, it's good enough.",

It took me about an hour to figure it all out on both platforms and get them talking to each other.

It depletes my battery like no other app (this relates to two difference devices). 2. I have to accept an icon at the top of the screen whenever it's running. Or remove it manually and get a constant warning from the battery monitor. 3. Stopping the battery monitor watching & optimising the app doesn't remove that icon. 4. If I restart the phone I then have to launch syncthing manually (even though it's supposed to run automatically) to start the syncing process. Apparently point 3 sfixes this... except it doesn't. I give up. Time to revert to a paid solution because at least it will just work out of the box without so many problems.",
