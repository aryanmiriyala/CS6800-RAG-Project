Love the idea of the app, hate losing notes like this.  Update / reply: I installed it together with getting a KolabNow account. My desktop client and KMail had been syncing the notes just fine, but as soon as I access them through Kolab Notes things go wrong. Even notes that were originally created there. The bits replaced by '?' chars was a Cyrillic address... I can understand not being able to display it, but finding out the address was gone in every client was less understandable. Worse so as I didn't actually modify the notes in Android, just opening them was apparently enough to trigger it. The overwriting issue is already in the Kolab bug tracker, I first thought it might be on their side. We did tests and the issue only occurs when Kolab Notes touches the note. Line endings are being converted to spaces in random moments, same thing there, without even editing a note, just reading triggers it.",
