Much suffering ensued and I was locked out of several important accounts. My mistake, but I'd still much rather have something that let's you backup your codes.",

It'd be great if there was an option to make biometric the default as well as making it so it doesn't require multiple gestures to access when it isn't the default. Edit: The developer responded and it looks like there's a way around said issue. Which is great! Going to move to 5 stars. It's a free (and great) tool so I don't want to be overly critical. It looks like other people have had this issue before as well so perhaps the UI should make it clear that this is a one time thing that will go away once you enter your pin.",

It's certainly not alphabetical. 2: How's about adding site icons for accounts, so they're easier to ID at a glance? 3: Some kind of countdown timer would be nice to show how long til the currently displayed code changes.

This fits my needs for an authenticator app and I'm impressed enough to make this my default authenticator (it was a toss up between this app and AndOTP), since my previous (paid) default app (Authenticator Plus) was abandoned by the developer. I hope there are easy donation options for this app or a simple donation app for the developers.",
