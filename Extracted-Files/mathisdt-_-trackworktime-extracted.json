This is great, but it does not allow what job you are on for each time period showing. Other than that, it's serving my needs. So far, it seems to be ad free and no other source needed to run it.",

Negative reviews are from lazy users not willing to fiddle around with the app. It serves it's purpose perfectly , unlike many other so called \"5 star\" apps. 95% of customers are dumb.
