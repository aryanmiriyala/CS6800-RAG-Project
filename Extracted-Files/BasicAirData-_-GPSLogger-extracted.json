But the interface is ugly, and the controls are unintuitive:  there is no single button to start/pause a track, instead you have to start a track by hitting \"Trackpoints\", and then you have to finish recording by hitting a tickmark somewhere else on the screen - not once, but twice!  There is no map inside the app, so you can't track your progress on a real map.  I could not get a saved track to show up in google earth on my device either.  Also, the KML file produced could not be loaded into google maps - produced an error about file being too long.  Probably some missing end tag or something like that.  Fortunately, the GPX file could be read by google maps and produced a good track on the map.  I am keeping it for now because it is open-source and ad-free, and serves its basic purpose.
