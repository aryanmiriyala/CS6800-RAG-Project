                "content": "My favorite game. I would give it 5 give stars if the campaign was not so darn difficult. What I would change: Create an easy medium and hard mode. In easy, make it so that the time to create items is fewer. Turrets need to be more robust and the use of alternate materials should be easier to use. The walls do not last long enough and it is not apparent in serp campaign what you need to advance. I think also increasing the rate that you mine too. The mod and editor though make up for that fact",

I Uninstaller out of pure rage... installed again to give 1 more try and it didn't save a map that I worked so hard to conquer and complete, then randomly unlocked another stupid unit that didn't have unlocked before. This has potential but it is so aggravating it's not even funny. Played with my SO and still can't bet the stupid levels. HATE THE GAME 3rd time trying it still frustrating and hard... not worth it",

The only bit i dont like is that when u try to move separate bits of blocks not yet built, the entire thing moves. Ex: 7 unbuilt conduits are connected while another 5 unbuilt conduits are connected somewhere else. When u move the conduit bit with 7 blocks, the conduit bit with 5 blocks will also move. I wish that we could move separate bits separately. Best game ever!!!!!",

The objective is that you launch to a location and extract resources while you're doing this, enemies spawn in waves. Some maps are a bit different. There is one MASSIVE problem with it though. On the nuclear factory map, the boss is incomprehensibly hard to kill. It is a flying boss with more range than any turret and who never enters the range of your turret. I spent 30 minutes manually firing guns to kill it it needs fixed",

Tutorials are really crucial and that's what gives the game to be player-friendly. It really is quite frustrating to guess on what to do, plus the controls aren't really practical; frankly, this is more suited to PC, which gives you more keys to press rather than just on your fingertips",
