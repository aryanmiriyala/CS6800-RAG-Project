No good swipe feature, not a complete punctuation set, and it's kinda clunky when switching between this, and Gboard for English, and Hebrew, but it's solid and stable and gets the job done. It's a work horse, not a show pony. When you've got work to do adding accents to your Greek text, this is how you get it done.",

If you press the enter key for either of these apps it sends the message instead of entering a space or creating a new paragraph. In other keyboard apps he is able to press shift + enter to create a new line or paragraph. If there was a way to do this it would be perfect for him. He only writes using polytonic Greek and is very frustrated since other android keyboards don't have all the accents he needs.",
