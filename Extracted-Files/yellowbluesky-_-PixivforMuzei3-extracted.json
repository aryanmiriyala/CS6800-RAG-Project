My only problem, and it is a minor one, is that I have it set to rotate my bookmarked images. It seems to pick up the latest 20 or so images I have bookmarked and rotates them, not getting any additional ones or earlier ones. But honestly, that might be because I have over 400+ bookmarked images and no fault of the app itself. I still highly recommend it.",
