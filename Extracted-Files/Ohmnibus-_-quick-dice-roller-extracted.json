Cons: (Really a wish list in disguise) - I wish there was a Windows compatible version. - I also wish I could figure out how to make it drop the lowest die in a 4d6 roll automatically for character generation.",

Cons:  - while you can turn off all sound, or you can toggle the critical success/failure and text-to-speech announcement of the roll-result, you can't disable the (annoying-after-a-while) dice-roll sound while keeping the other sounds  - it only produced dice results, not messages such as \"success\" or \"failure\" if you're rolling to beat a certain threshold  Neither of the items in my Cons list are deal-breakers, just added functionality that would make a great app even more useful.  After trying a couple others, this one gave me what I wanted.",

In addition, variables can be set to show say levels or health and be used in the dice rolls. Quick Dice Roller is free and open source software, and features not only common dice seen in most RPGs, but also the ability to customize certain rolls and use variables in calculating the right number for the game situation.",
