Admittedly it took me a minute to figure out how the bits are arranged (I'm more used to BCD, and have only seen true binary arranged as two separate horizontal lines) but once I figured out which dot corresponded to which bit I actually found it quite a bit easier to read than any other true binary clock I've tried. The one and only gripe I've got with this widget is that the bits that are turned off - the difference in color between them and the bits that are turned on seem to be in a spot where maybe every 1 in 20 times I look at the clock I'll misread it thinking a bit that's turned on is actually off or vice versa. This is basically a roundabout way of saying I think in a future update it might be nice to be able to customize the color and/or transparency of bits that are turned off. It's a minor thing, I was going to only take a half a star off but it turns out Google doesn't let you use half stars so the 4.5 gets rounded up to a 5.",
