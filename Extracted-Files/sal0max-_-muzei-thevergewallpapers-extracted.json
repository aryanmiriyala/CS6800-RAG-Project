Tried clearing cache, data, and reinstalling it but nothing worked.--- 5 stars because it worked extremely well. Downloaded like 20 different wallpapers on first use. NatGeo one only downloaded 2 tho.ü´§ So yeah. Great job on this.üëç The wallpaper type this download just isn't my thing so I'm going back. If you like this type of wallpaper then this is the plugin for you.",
