I'm coming over from Standard Notes because Joplin offers a lot more functionality like bullet points, checklists, media, etc. but the Android app doesn't offer a ribbon bar with the option to use these features. Instead, you must memorize the text formatting such as **this** for bold text or *this* for italicized text, which seems very old-fashioned. Sliding in from the left doesn't pull out the sidebar like you would expect which is something you must do regularly, as the sync button is in this sidebar. Instead, you must press the button at the top left which gets annoying if you have a large phone because it's a two-handed process. The status bar is a dark gray color with black text (a bit hard to read, especially outdoors) instead of just conforming to the selected theme, and the sync button wouldn't give me the prompt to connect to the Dropbox until I uninstalled and reinstalled to set the app back up (there is no option to open the prompt yourself as far as I'm aware). The overall app design doesn't really follow the material design language either, but it does get the job done. In comparison to Standard Notes, Joplin's multi-device syncing is very slow. It will automatically sync no sooner than every 5 minutes unless you manually hit the sync button, which is fine if you like to use one device at a time, but I'm so used to the instantaneous syncing in Standard Notes where I can paste a link using my phone and see it on my computer within a couple of seconds that I just don't think Joplin is a worthy replacement. It would not hurt to try Joplin, especially because it's completely free and open-source, but it's hard to recommend because there are so many better options like OneNote or Evernote that most people would enjoy more.",

                "content": "This is a useful and interesting app on the desktop but the syncing to Android is a nightmare. If you are coming from Evernote, and have a substantial collection of notes, be prepared to lose hours on the first sync. Joplin on android only syncs in the foreground and only while the phone is awake. So the first thing to do is to get hold of an app like screenon which will keep the phone awake while the first long sync gets under way. Then resign yourself to not being able to use the phone for anything else for the next few hours. I'm writing this four hours after starting a sync of 10,000 notes through dropbox, and with at least an hour to go. Webdav and onedrive are reportedly even slower. There is a dedicated Joplin sync server under development but for the moment you need to be comfortable with docker and github to get it working. Once the first sync is done, subsequent ones seem to happen at reasonable speeds, because only changed files are moved. But the only practical way I can see to transfer a substantial collection of notes to the phone is to let the sync process run overnight. Apart from that, this is an impressive app on the desktop, where it imported 10,000 notes from Evernote in less than half an hour. The use of Markdown makes for much smaller, lighter files, and , if you're used to it, pretty much faff-free editing. There is an impressive ecosystem of plugins to extend its functionality and helpful online community. It has an excellent webclipper for desktop use. If you don't already have a large investment in other note taking systems it's well worth looking at Joplin. But this is a review of the Android app, and the syncing failures really drag it down.",
