                "content": "Great to have no ads and no tracking, but bad to be no fun to play. Two problems could easily be fixed for a five-star game: (1) Upon either winning or losing, the game immediately blocks the view of the board, so it is not possible to review one's play to consider his it might be improved. (2) Minesweepers should open squares by quick tapping and mark them by long tapping. This one requires for a button to be pressed to toggle between these functions, destroying the flow of the game.",

The game is silent; a loud explosion sound when uncovering a bomb would make the game more thrilling (I can always mute android volume). I haven't yet found a mobile clone that does this properly besides microsoft's own minesweeper (PC). Also, tapping a button to switch between flag/uncover is slow, it could be improved with gestures e.g. long-tap.",
