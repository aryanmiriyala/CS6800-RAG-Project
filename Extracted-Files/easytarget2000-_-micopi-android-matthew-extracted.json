Recently, the developer updated the free version to no longer work I have no problem with supporting the developer, however the premium version of the app lacks the basic functionality that used to exist. The new interface is terrible and even the \"premium\" version doesn't let you do the things the free version used to. Needless to say I am upset and will be issuing a refund. Please add functionality back - I'd be willing to pay!",
