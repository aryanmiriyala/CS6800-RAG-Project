Please make it clear in the description that this is NOT a KeePass client. Edit: Reply to dev comment: Then you shouldn't have picked the exact same name as a well popular, and liked password manager (with the same capitalization and everything). If I see an app named Facebook, I'd assume it'd have something to do with the social media platform.",
