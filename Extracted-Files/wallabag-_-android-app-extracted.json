I came across wallabag on an alternatives to Pocket and GrabMyBooks site and decided to give it a run, liking the fact the it was open source and free. But my problems were just about to start. First, on the Chrome version, it asks for a domain name. Well, I don’t understand such stuff about domain names, etc. I can just about turn on my the computer. So, after a time, I decided to leave the Chrome extension and give the android app a run instead; surely this would be a lot simpler; a piece of cake, I thought. I then downloaded and installed the app, only to have the same type of issues about domains for a second time. I then went online and, after a while, set up an account with wallabag and found that I could then get the app working, without knowing about domains or being a tech wizard. But then I noticed that I was on a trial period, after which, as I read it, I’d have to take out some kind of subscription to continue using the app/account. So, at this point, I deleted my account, removed the app from my phone and browser, and wished I’d never bothered in the first place. 1 star.",
