Same for other daily tally data sets. If you added a '+1' & 'reset to zero' at a custom time, that would greatly improve it. Still, I am very pleased with what's on offer here. *response: I want to see specific mood differences throughout the day in relation to coffee's drunk. I.e. does a cup of coffee cause mania, mood dip etc? After how many coffees does my mood alter significantly? Do my energy levels fall off after coffee three? Simply using a daily total does not tell me this information, it's not specific enough to demonstrate mood and energy shifts minutes and hours apart. Don't get me wrong, I can work around it, but adding my proposed additions would resolve the issue entirely and allow more flexible data entry and interpretation. Just a suggestion. It's still the best software for tracking such things and displaying them in graph format.",
