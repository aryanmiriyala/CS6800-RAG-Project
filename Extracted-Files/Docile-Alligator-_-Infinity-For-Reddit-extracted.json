Adding great dev support to the review, which bumps it up to a resounding 5. Amazing app, and great devs!",

Other than that slight annoyance it's pretty much better in every way.",

I especially like that I can view things similar to the official app where i see the pics/videos in the feed without having to click in each one. The navigation is intuitive. I like the tags oneach post as well-it's hard to miss. And it strips out the annoying aspects of the official app. The one problem I have is that if I am looking at my home feed, it feels like it doesn't update as the official app does, and I miss a lot of posts unless I go into each subreddit individually. I might have something set up wrong or not understand, but refreshing doesn't change the content as it does in the official app. So, I run out of posts pretty fast it feels like. Still, much better than official app and I like it better than the others I've tried.",
