If I am on 20 minutes and someone else is on 30 minutes, pause and play is simply resuming where each on is. Ideally it should keep both at the same time in video all the time 3 - 10 secs fast forward and 10 seconds back is much needed feature 4 - When you scroll and jump to specific time in window, your partner should also jump.",
