I can control multiple locomotives from the same screen and I have a power button at the top that cuts power to the track and stops everything dead. Everything is configurable with many options.

Had the LnWi hooked up in a minute and the app working in another two. I had previously installed it so I was already familiar with it. The only set-up issue I had was that the Engine Driver would not see the LnWi. I had to go to the WiFi settings on my Android phone and it found the LnWi and connected immediately. I started of using the single, right side, switching throttle. (There are many to select from in the app.) Selecting locos is as simple as typing their address. Worked perfect, right off the bat. I especially like the way the throttle releases locos. Just click release. No more multi-button presses like on a regular throttle. The only thing I didn't like is that with the switching throttle, you have one vertical slider for speed, with forward from the center, up and reverse from the center, down. The center off position is a bit vague, and you sometimes get the wrong direction for the first couple of speed steps. Might just be my big fingers. So far, I like it more that any of my other throttles. I will continue to experiment with selecting other styles of throttles in the app. OH yea. As I was running last night, a new young fellow, about 11 or 12 years old came into the train store with his Mom and joined the club. (The Northwest Indiana N Scalers) I was able to download the app onto her phone, set it up and he was running in 10 minutes. A really great app.",

Was even thinking of giving up on it I then noticed that jrmi was now compatible with gauge master so bought a computer interface cable to link the base unit with my laptop and then via WiFi to my phone with this app installed. What an improvement! its made it fun again so a big thank you to all the people who developed this app you saved my hobby.",
