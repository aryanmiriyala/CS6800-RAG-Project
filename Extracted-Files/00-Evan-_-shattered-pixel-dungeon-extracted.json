Has been worked on for 8+ years, tons of replayability, combinations, items, and interactions. Super cool that it's available for free on Android, and is also multiplatform. Definitely consider supporting with money if you also enjoy the game, dev earned it. Multiplayer would be awesome but that would certainly come with big design decisions and solutions needed. Can't recommend the game enough, thanks.",

(I know it is possible but it would be great if it was more user friendly) - secondly, the ability to start a \"creative\" run (toggolable godmode, spawn items, etc...) Other than that, I think this game is amazing and I'm sure that with the current update schedule this game has great possibility.",

What that means isn't that every time you die or win it was because of dice, but more of you have to really think about all of your options with what you have. Sometimes you'll get an OP staff one time, some random seeds another, but so long as you know how and when to use them, you'll win anyways! This game is a lot more tactical then I think a lot of the negative reviews give it credit for. Besides, 100's of hours into a free game? Great value to time ratio lol",

Currently on floor 20 hoping to not die again from the king of dwarves best of luck to me and to you guys playing this game and looking forward for more!",

Доволі довго проходив, часто не вдавалось вийти з підземелля. А теперь не вистачає нових рівнів та персонажів. Гра не набридає, її цікаво проходити навіть коли вже кілька разів пройшов. Перші рази складно зрозуміти, що треба робити. Але це не відвертає гравця, а навпаки - ще більше зацікавлює. Безумовно рекомендую. Дякую розробнику.",

To die because you can't find food on 2 levels in a row, after you balanced your use of food, is a little harsh. I would suggest adding food that can spawn again on levels you already completed as a solution. Still, a really nice game",

Each round I've found it to be a unique experience, I love how random the dungeon layouts to be, and the difficulty provides a good challenge. All the bad reviews, all seem to be complaints about the difficulty, so if you're not looking for something that'll be hard (trust me it is), just don't get the game. No need to leave a bad review because it's hard.",
