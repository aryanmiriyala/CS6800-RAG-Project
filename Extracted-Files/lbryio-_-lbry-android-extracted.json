The streaming is less than decent, a lot of buffering. Auto-rotating has issues. I wish it was easier to leave a comment.",

So in order to post anything or make any comments you have to buy their points. You end up 'paying' by letting them use your bandwidth for their torrent back end. This is a good idea that seems to be being exploited. I had no problems with the app, my problem is with the verification system and the people behind the curtain.",

In an effort to boycott Zuckerberg and friends, I'm willing to be patient with the kinks in the app. Loading speed has been slowing improving over the last few months and I'm sure there'll be more improvements on the way. I noticed I got \"free\" coins but then charged for having a channel so while odysee is a fantastic idea and great potential, it may not be an ideal long term solution if it will be charging users.",

Also mini player requaireing a \"go back\" key press makes it needlesly requaire a 3. step (1-Select video 2-shift up to revial the keys at the bottom 3-press the button) to play a video and browse at the same time. Over all it is a useable app made for a group of people. If added more options it will be for all. One thing it cant beat for now is how flexable youtube can be.",

If it was not for this one MAJOR MAJOR issue, i would not rate it so low. No parent in their right mind would allow kids to use an app that allows adult content to easily get through. I found that even with the mature content button turned off i was still able to access xxx stuff. I think everything about this platform is amazing but this is a bigger deal than this company realizes.FIX",

I hope that it is a something fixable, I would like to use lbry more.",
