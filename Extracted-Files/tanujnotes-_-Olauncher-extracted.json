I stayed because of: the ad-free experience, minimal load on the phone battery, support for dual accounts and intuitive left/right corner swipe for heavily accessed apps. I've grown used to the launcher and it doesn't keep me off my phone completely, but I find myself being less bombarded and stimulated, which goes a long way for me. Thanks to the dev for doing such a wonderful job. ❤️",

However it would be great to have the possibility to add a few more app on the home screen (in my case 2 more would be perfect - 10 apps in total) Also it would be great if we could set and display app aliases instead of having their full names (which sometimes is too verbose and lengthy)",

I will keep using the app even if I can't resolve the issue because I can't stand anything else and your app does what I want perfectly except for this.

Insufficient Customizability - the experimental double tap lock sucks cause I've to use pattern every time to unlock and the clock that can't be resizeable etc. Take my suggestions please.",
