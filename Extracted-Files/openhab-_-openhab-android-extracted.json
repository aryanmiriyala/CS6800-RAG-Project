For a setpoint widget with step=0.5, if the widget has a current value with a fraction, e.g. 14.5, the widget behaves correctly. But, if the current value is a whole number, e.g. 14, then the list of values are displayed as integers with each value twice, e.g. 13,13,14,14,15,15 etc., i.e. 14.5 is displayed as 14. Also, the up arrow increments by 1, and the down arrow doesn't work. Fixed - All good now, thanks!",

What used to be solid colors became a pale shading with solid borders and with a slightly darker font. That's not great at all and I prefer the older scheme. Great companion for OH server. I just wish for the addition of right control carets from the basic UI because it's difficult to differentiate when pressing an icon can open a new frame.",

Old review: It's a 3.5. Maybe a 4. If it supported multiple servers it wouldn't be less than a 4.5. Multiple sitemaps on the same server it'll see but I have to rely on 3hou.se to use my setup at work AND home without changing settings all the time. 3hou.se actually auto detects servers too. Can we get that here? Kthxbai!",

If you don't like the new icon, feel free to use a launcher with the ability to change app icons. Multiple sitemaps and auto discovery are both support. For more questions: community.openhab.org",
