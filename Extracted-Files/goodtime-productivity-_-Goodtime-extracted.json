Edit: upgrading to 5 stars because the app is \"intelligent\" and schedules 15 min of breaks when you have actually done 4 sessions back to back. I upgraded like 4 months ago and love it!!",

Just one thing so far I would like to point out / ask for: the ability to manually select multiple labels for pomodoro's would, in my opinion, be an absolutely great addition to the app. Preferably before as well as after sessions. But besides that I am very happy with the purchase right now. Will update my review as I use the app. Another suggestion: adaptive scaling for graphs/charts. Thank you. Edit: found a workaround for my problem by making additional labels.",

Im really thankful for the creators who made this but I think it still has alot to improve. Personally, i think it could have done better if there was another setting where you could input a whole schedule and it ring on time. of course that would almost be a waste since theres a \"clock\" on just any phone but its also good to take the opportunity to combine both functions in one app",
