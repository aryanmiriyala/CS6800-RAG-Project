I contacted developer and still no response Edit: I have emailed the app developer three times prior and just sent another email today after seeing the reply. Will update review accordingly Edit 2: 1 month later still no reply. Avoid this app and upgrading to pro at all cost. Edit 3: 9/17/21 2 months later still no reply.",

There are also numerous cards and loyalty programs missing, e.g. Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles and Citi Custom Cash. Other than that, this app is a good way to keep track of your cards without having to log in to anything or to risk your data being sold.",
