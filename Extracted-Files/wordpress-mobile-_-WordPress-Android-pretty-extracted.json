Not only this is a very comfortable app for blogging, but its name 'Wordpress' was more suited to it than the widely general, though uplifting, impersonal 'Jetpack', that eventually says nothing. 'Wordpress' has a legacy and a strong bond to publishing. But again, as in many other cases, change supersedes established identity. I kept the stars. I love the app, although it's not perfect.",
