Some suggestions: Would it be possible to export the expectrogram as a raster to extract your own statistics?. Would it be possible, on the other hand, to save   user-static measurements? Imagine we try to take indoor registration: the GPS is not going to work so the user stays fixed in a point for few second (a point with the mean/median value of dB per Hz is saved in a register/row), then he stops, walk to the next and repeats the operation. A unique geo.json or shp would be exported, the indoor coordinates would be added and shown in any other application, fugro viewer for example. I will continue playing.",
