And also swipe, from that side (which you set up to tap) gets to work very bad. And unskipable notification... That's just weird. So, to run your app in usual way will be way faser and easier.",

Dev - I know this hasn't been updated in years but I'm sure I'm not the only one who would pay for this if you updated to add a tile option or the ability to launch the gesture screen as it's own app so it could be tied to double tap button. With Wear finally getting more popular maybe you could cash in haha",

Three problem is that it does not open the gesture recognizer reliably. I have to tap the edge multiple times for it to launch. TIP: Assign the watch home button double tap to launch the gesture launcher. Then go to settings of gesture launcher and set \"show launcher\" to OFF. Then you can double tap to open the recognized everytime! Thanks for the app!",
