As other reviewers have mentioned, it's too easy to get to normal Reddit through video posts, but perhaps an option to disallow video posts would be a way around whatever technical problem is involved in displaying the video posts without a reddit link. Again thanks for making this app.",

Basically making it unusable :( I marked 4 stars because I love the idea, and the attitude of the developer (I saw him saying honestly and directly that he won't implement more viewed posts, commets etc, even tho saying that might disappoint some people). I think after you fix this problem the app would be legit and usable. Right now I don't recommend anyone to download it unfortunately. Reddit is mostly about videos and gifs.",
