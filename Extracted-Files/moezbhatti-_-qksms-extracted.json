I like that I can send more than 2 photos at a time which I could not do with my previous app. And they just added the feature to copy certain parts of the text instead of the whole text being copied!  One main reason for choosing the app is that the developers actually read and respond to users. And they take into consideration those points that can be improved upon! Thanks for listening guy!!  Kudos to you! One of the other things my old app use to do that was WAY cool was it had a voice recorder option, any chance of adding that cool feature??? ;D",

For \nreference I'm using the Piktures gallery app, if that helps you figure out \nthis bug. Dark mode is fantastic by the way. Hopefully you get the picture \nmessaging bug figured out! It's not a huge loss that I can't wait to have \nfixed. One suggestion I have, is that you make it so that the app \nautomatically scrolls to the bottom of the messages when opening the \nkeyboard. At least with my phone, it seems to not do so and you have to \nclose the keyboard in order to see them. If you weren't aware of this, \nwell, you're welcome lol. It would be a significant QOL improvement. Thanks \nfor the great free app! I wish you well in fixing these things soon.",
