Has the basic features I need for a to-do list app. A few things are a bit wonky, like how clicking the + puts your list in side-bar limbo (that took me a while to find).

Otherwise, people have to download each individual app. So that they notes and to do list kept private in one place and with an encrypted backup file locally. Users can either sync that folder on their oqn to cloud storage by themselves or using other auto sync app.   In case, the mobile hp is lost, or upgraded to another device, information can be retrieve again.
