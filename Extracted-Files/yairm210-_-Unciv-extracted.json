While I understand that many players would like change in certain aspects, like AI and difficulty, I feel like it would reduce the charm of the original game, where you can mock the stupid AI relentlessly while still being mad that they won a Science Victory 1 turn earlier than you. There is also the hard loading time, some players complain about that, however, this will also be the case when you make the same thing in a high-end PC.",
