                "content": "This app works well IF you set it up right.  The problem is knowing what to do as there is no guide for setup with a YubiKey as mentioned below.  In case it helps others out there, this is what my setup was on a device running Android 9 with a YubiKey 5 NFC.  I used KeePassXC to set-up the challenge response function with my YubiKey along with a strong Master Key.  If I did the same with KeePass 2.40, the database just would not work with Keepass2Android and ykDroid.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, make sure the Encryption Algorithm is set to AES-256 and the Key Derivation Function is set to AES-KDF (KDBX 4) in database settings.  Then with the Keepass2Android app, make sure your Master Key setting is set to \"Password + Challenge-Response for KeePass XC\".  I couldn't even start the database unlock with any other setting.  Once these things were done with the respective software and database file, the app worked seamlessly.  With better instructions for the less patient among us, I would give it 5 stars, but without, I'll give it 4 for effort and forward thinking.  Thanks for laying the groundwork for a great way to better secure our sensitive information on a mobile platform",

Turns out neither this app or KeePass2Android have instructions for this new feature, so here's the details for those who are confused or think it's not working, like I initially did.   You keep the normal selection for your challenge. It'll ask you to select where the xml file is, normally in the same folder as your KeePass database. After it reads the file, it'll quickly recognize the format and ask you to select which slot on your YubiKey to scan from. It's 4 stars now because it does work, but due to no instructions, it's a little confusing. However I like it so far.",
