I notice setting BG to black, Color to dark,dark green, and Focus to very-light, saturated green is most readable for me (the eyes are most sensitive to green light). The way this app carries the highlighted region across is more natural than the \"single-word\" approach because the former closely resembles actual reading. Also, how it pulses as it scrolls across the horizontal forces the eyes to stutter, microsaccades strongly modulate neurons in the primary areas of the visual cortex.",
