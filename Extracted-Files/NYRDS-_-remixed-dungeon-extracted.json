For example, if I was in a narrow hallway, a snail on my right and my deathling on my left, if I would command it to attack the snail, it would go around a new way, which is very frustrating.",

What is Armor of metabolism, bounce, potential, etc 4. Wraiths need to more hittable with normal weapons 5. Need more wands dropped to improve gameplay variety",

There are some really irritating things with the user interface, like moving by tapping. Please make an optional control scheme. Like allow the player to use a D-pad. And the leveling system needs some work as well, you level up but dont get points to distribute. Whats even the point of haveing a player class then if you can't make your player have the strenghts and weaknesses you want it to. Thanks",
