I have it in vibrate mode now (which is most of the time for me) and it hasn't worked for several text messages, which two different people. Eugene perhaps there is an advanced setting I'm missing or just a glitch every now and then?...It's free and generally works, so how could I complain. It does take some testing out as there are lots of settings. Since there was no built in notification reminder in the Pixel 3 it would force me to check my phone often as there is no way to hear the vibrate on the Pixel 3 even when set to strongest. With this reminder I don't have to check rather I get a reminder, which is the way is should have been (and be so reliant and focused on that screen)! However, as stated it is not 100% work with the text messages (which is what I use this app for) but darn near close.",
