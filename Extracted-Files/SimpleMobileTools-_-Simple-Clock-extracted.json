One suggestion: in 12-hour mode, make \"am\" and \"pm\" special icons and make them smaller. Currently they are as big as the digits but unnecessary, and I prefer 12 over 24 hour.",

During the alarm when touching the status bar mutes the volume but the vibration keeps going.(make the alarm full screen so that the only way to stop ringing is through slider of the alarm). Please fix it so i can give 5 star rating. 3. Proper white theme all around.",

No fancy cheap looks, just pure modern aesthethic simplicity. No ads. Fast response time. It reminds me so much of the default Clock app for Windows Mobile 10, which I still miss so dearly! There is still one last feature, that I greatly miss and is incredibly useful: Adding more timers (with own labels). The same like on Clocks and Alarms tabs, but for Timers. Then your app will be just perfect 💚 Please add this, I beg you. Default Android apps, Google app and Huawei app doesn't have this. It is a great niche to fill. Thank you, and you've done a really great job on all those simple apps! Have a great day, Michael",

Inexplicably, Android considers alarms \"Media\", not \"Notifications\"—so there's just one volume for music to help you fall asleep, and alarms to wake you.
