The spell list in Citadel of Chaos frequently bugs out, appending a junk character to the end of each spell, randomly duplicating spells, or vanishing entirely. Character creation will blank out your stats if you change your device's orientation during before finishing. Sometimes the notes screen will stop displaying new notes until you re-open the app. If it all worked a little better this would be a 5 out of 5.",
