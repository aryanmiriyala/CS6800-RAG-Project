Maybe not supported? Unfamiliar with all of this so far. Another thing that is frustrating, not having or allowing a dark mode/theme. kills battery, screen and eyes especially(especially at night). Seems to be a lack of options throughout, especially compared to other similar apps. Thanks, appreciate it. Keep it up. Will update review",
