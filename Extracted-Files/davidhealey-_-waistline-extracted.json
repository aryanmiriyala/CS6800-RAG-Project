It reset my settings and lost my entries twice in a short period of time. It cannot search OFF entries. This isn't the fault of Waistline but I also had so many problems just trying to make an account on OFF (they blocked all Zoho addresses, app crashes frequently, contributions disappear, other UI bugs) that this just isn't worth the hassle.",
