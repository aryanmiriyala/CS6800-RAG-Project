After connecting to external icecast server from the app and locking the screen, the audio seems to go to sleep a minute or so after the phone locks. Pixel 6, Android 12 with a Behringer UCA 202 connected with a USB-C to USB F adapter. I've gone into app permissions and given it unrestricted battery and unlimited network permissions. Problem persists. 5 stars if you can help resolve! :)",
