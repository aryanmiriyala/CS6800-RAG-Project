It's hard to overstate just how easy this is to use if you have some basic knowledge of http requests and JS. Everything is laid out very nicely and intuitively. The only thing that gave me a tiny bit of trouble was figuring out the variable system, so I could update a variable with one shortcut, and use that value with another. But it's amazing that's even possible in the first place. I don't know if this is possible, but I'd love to see the ability to add more richly formatted content in messages displayed. Images, CSS, html. But I'm asking for feature creep at this point. As-is, this app is amazing.",
