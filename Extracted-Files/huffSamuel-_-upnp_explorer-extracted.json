My UPnP player app at fault, a communication problem or was UPnP just not broadcasting over this wifi? UPnP tells me exactly what UPnP and even dnla servers are connected. I now have some useful debug data to feed back to the router manufacture. Their router can be set to serve UPnP via WAN and I see it in this app if that is switched on.",
