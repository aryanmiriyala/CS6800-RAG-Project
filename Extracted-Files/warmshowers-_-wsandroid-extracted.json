You can't even read new messages in there but you'll get redirected to their website which has one of the worst mobile layouts I've ever come across. \"Beta version\" would probably the best term to describe this app. This is a shame, because the concept itself is really nice.",

However, it is volunteers who develop the app in their spare time. So it might take another month or two to release it. But integrating messaging into the app is definitively one of the planned features. So stay tuned! =)",
