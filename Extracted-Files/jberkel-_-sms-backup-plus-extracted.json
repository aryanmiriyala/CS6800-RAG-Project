It's hard to knock an app that has been invaluable to me for years, did exactly what it says it would and is available for \"free\". I too have not been able to backup since August 2019, until today. I was reading some of the reviews and fortunately stumbled upon the Edge workaround. So I now have 4,406 messages left to backup from what started as 9,417. The backup fails after a few hundred so be prepared to babysit the app (i.e. don't think that it will work continuously once you finally get it going). I wish it didn't take me so long to find the workaround but I am certainly happy I did not give up trying.",
