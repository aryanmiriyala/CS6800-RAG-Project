I've had multiple times where I receive a notification but clicking on it takes me to the chat where it sits trying to load the message for a while. That's when I get a notification at all, of course. More recently notifications haven't been working. Nonetheless, I'm a big proponent of Matrix as a concept and recognize it's a complex undertaking.",
