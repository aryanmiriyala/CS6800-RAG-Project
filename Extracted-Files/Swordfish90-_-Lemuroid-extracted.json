However, last night I went on to install it on my Galaxy Tab S7...when i went to choose my directory a few hours ago, it crashes almost immediately & doesn't open the finder & when it was functioning, it took over an hour to scan the same small roms that took my phone less than 2 minutes to to scan fully. Please, take this issue/bug into consideration...Thank You.",
