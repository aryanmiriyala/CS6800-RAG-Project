                "content": "It's a great app. It does what it's supposed to do, and it's probably the best RPG Maker emulator on the Play Store. Most games I played with this app worked without fail (besides JoJo, the shift key doesn't work, but there are logs for that on the easyrpg website). The Gray Garden and Wadanohara are among my favorites! It is ad-free too, so there should be no interruptions during gameplay. However, the app only supports RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games, and there are only so many good games for those versions. This of course means games such as Pokémon Uranium, Mad Father, and Misao won't work, as Uranium uses a different version of RPG Maker, and the other two use WOLF RPG Editor, not RPG Maker (so do your research before installing a game into EasyRPG)! Overall, if you want to play some RPG Maker games on the go, this is a great option. I hope that in the future later iterations of RPG Maker are implemented! Keep up the good work!  EDIT: I would also like to add some info about fonts for anyone looking in the reviews! EasyRPG uses a different font than usual on PC, but some games use special fonts for different situations and symbols that EasyRPG can't recognize. For example, in Mother - Cognitive Dissonance, Mr. Saturn uses a custom font, which is translated into random symbols in EasyRPG. I hope EasyRPG changes this to work later.",

It's a very minor error though, and didn't affect gameplay at all.   My only other critique is that a clearer explanation of how to get games running would be good (namely explicitly stating that you need to download the game from the internet, unzip the game folder, and move it to the right directory). I figured it out on my own but it seems like a few others didn't based on some of the other reviews.

Also the screen in vertical mode is a little too high but other than that it works great just needs a few kinks ironed out. If anyone could help me troubleshoot some of the issues that be cool as well.",

The one the app has is very primitive compared to a Yamaha type of sound font. Maybe by pairing it with another app or something running in the background? It can really be useful for this app, as many Rm2003 games use midi files.",
