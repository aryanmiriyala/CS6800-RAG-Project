Also: clicking on links to posts in other servers redirects you away, so you can't like, boost, or comment (other clients address this). App feels high quality otherwise.",

When you load new posts it shoots you to the top of the list. This is the MOST disgusting aspect of this UI for me. Look at twitter for inspiration. When new tweets load in twitter you stay where you are in the feed and can keep scrolling up as you please right from where you left off. - Needs fixed immediately 2. The feed does not automatically update when new posts are available. - Make it an option 3. Not enough options to view things like followers and such like other reviewers have already mentioned. - Much needed 4. No way to view the fully federated view. - Might be too much for the average user. Fix 1,2 and 3 and you have a winner 100%",
