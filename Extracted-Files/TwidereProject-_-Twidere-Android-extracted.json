Started looking around for a client that didn't mess my timeline up and this is so much better than the official app. One problem I've increasingly noticed is that media content posted by someone using \"Twitter for Advertisers\" does not show up in tweets, you have to do \"Open in Browser\" to see it (and unless the tweet refers to the media, it's not always obvious that there is media in the tweet). Update: All good things come to an end. X com blocking 3rd party wins out.",

Only request I have is for different colour bubbles in DM section as that can get pretty confusing where they are the same. Notifications are a little slow but nothing major. Overall very happy!",
