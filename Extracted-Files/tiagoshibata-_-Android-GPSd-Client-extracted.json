App is very simple to use, and you can do whatever you want with the data received at the server side. Very cool and practical at the same time.",

It would be interesting to add some more features though, like: 1. setting the transmit interval in seconds 2. possibility to configure the required precision of GPS coordinates 3. toggle switch if message should be sent always, or only if position is different from the last one",
