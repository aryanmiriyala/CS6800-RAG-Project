Satisfactory per-file and global customization, from link color and font size (view or edit mode) to tailored html for markdown. You can back up the settings in JSON 👍 Sometimes a bit laggy on view switch. Doesn't seem to have its own sync system, but that's a bonus for me, less feature-creep, delegating it to another sync service. Cheers!",

Sure you can get away with just making a plain text file, but this has syntax highlighting and the ability to organise each and every task. FOSS really never ceases to amaze.",

                "content": "This is brilliant! It is so cool that I've given it 5 stars, even though it has problems exporting to HTML and PDF. Otherwise it works like a charm. It actually loads linked html pages, so it works as an excellent reader for local HTML pages, and it does display its own exported HTML. I can read its exported PDF on my Linux desktop, but not on my smartphone. It would be great to include or link to a sample markdown page to show off its capabilities for those new to markdown.",

I'd be perfectly willing to pay for such an option. (However, in the mean time, I am using 'Autosync for Google Drive' and it's working perfectly.)

Reason: I have a workspace with a Library folder (list of books with literature notes in it) and a Zettelkasten folder (permanent notes that links to my literature notes in the other folder).

But since I joined this app only yesterday, it is become so much easier to edit and to add on. So far, I'm loving it!",
