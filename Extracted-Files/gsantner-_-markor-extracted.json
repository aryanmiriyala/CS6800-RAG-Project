Not to mention, it comes with dark mode! Huge help for me to collect my thoughts and plans about my programming projects. Thank you!",

You can back up the settings in JSON ð Sometimes a bit laggy on view switch. Doesn't seem to have its own sync system, but that's a bonus for me, less feature-creep, delegating it to another sync service. Cheers!",

Sure you can get away with just making a plain text file, but this has syntax highlighting and the ability to organise each and every task. FOSS really never ceases to amaze.",

It actually loads linked html pages, so it works as an excellent reader for local HTML pages, and it does display its own exported HTML. I can read its exported PDF on my Linux desktop, but not on my smartphone. It would be great to include or link to a sample markdown page to show off its capabilities for those new to markdown.",

Instead of storing all of your info in some in-app database you just keep the individual files in the directory of your choice. Markor does a great job of displaying and editing the docs, but doesn't try to lock you in. And your files look **great** in the app. Its fast and responsive as well. And these screenshots don't do it justice.",
