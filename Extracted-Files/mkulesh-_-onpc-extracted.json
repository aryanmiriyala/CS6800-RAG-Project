The only issue I find is if you have the app installed on two devices (tablet and cell phone) and it is running on the first device, it will crash if the second device tries to access the receiver. Not a deal breaker, simple power cycle the receiver and limit use to one device! Thank-you Mikhail for writing this app! I no longer have to return inside when listening to zone two on my patio to change Pandora settings or turning down the volume when the wife complains!",

                "content": "What a phenomenal improvement over the app that Onkyo/Pioneer supplies! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to do this. So intuitive and useful! I found this because I was monkeying around with the Github repo you forked as the basis of this app. One unfortunate problem I am having with the app is that the Setup (gear) button does nothing. The \"Quick menu\" (three lines) button works as expected and brings up on-screen menu just fine. But, Setup does nothing from any state of the receiver or the app. Would love to see this fixed. Let me know how I can help (I am not familiar with Android development, but I can test!)",
