Theres no clear way to disable the greyscale shortcut icons in the wheel. Dragging up brings up a search, theres no way to turn that into an app drawer, that's only available through a few extra steps. You are always limited to the 8 gesture shortcuts, no option to add additional outer rings or folders which expand the wheel.",

Thanks for your work! --Update-- very good, very efficient and intuitive launcher indeed! Thanks again!! I wasn't able to find the repo for the OnePlus 3 launcher I was referring to earlier, sorry. Suggestions: another ring of 12 quick access apps, please? bigger icons for the 8 (+12) quick access apps, please?",
