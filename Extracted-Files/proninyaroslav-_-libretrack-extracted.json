It took 6 tries of clearing app data until I could enter my USPS API Key. And when I added my package--\"A hard error has occured, tracking stopped. Please check details inside\", except I can't click to see the details. EDIT: Can now see details. Needed to contact USPS to activate the trackV2 API--this step was not listed. Will wait and see if this works.",
