It seems to have improved it's \"document detection\" ability - it's able to pick up (for me) a page on a lower contrast background than it could previously. That's good as I'm having to scan documents on a light background much of the time. On the other hand, the image processor seems to have lost a little bit in this iteration. Documents that used to be crisp are now unreadable with the image processor enabled, and many times I have to scan a document with the processor disabled. All in all it's still a useful tool and you can't beat the \"no ads\" and simple interface, but I'd like to see the image processing brought back to the level it was in prior versions.",
