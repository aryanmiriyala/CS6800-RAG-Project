It's got backups, it's got data exports, it's got a dark mode... it's absolutely perfect. This is the app I'd make for myself, if i knew how to make apps.",

It has cool widgets, you can set goals for how much time you want to devote to an activity per day/week/month... SO GOOD!!! üò≠üò≠üíï",

If there was one thing I would request, it would be a total time column in the CSV sheet download. I'd like to be able to share my tracking with admin (who would not be using the app) and I don't know how to make that happen with the start/stop columns in Excel. Then it would be perfect! Edit: Changed to five stars. I found a how-to on doing this in Excel. Search for: \"How to calculate time in Excel - time difference, adding / subtracting times.\" It would still be really cool if it was added to the CSV, but I can manage it with a little tweaking.",

You can have multiple different activities in the app and colour code them, so I'm finding it useful for a variety of things. I have ADHD so I lose track of time very easily and have a hard time sticking to tasks. One feature I'd find useful is a reminder to switch task if I've been on the same one for a long time. Thank you so much for making this app.",

Seems like apps do one or the other. Time tracking or food & supplements tracking. Right now I do it manually in a markdown note app but was hoping for something with faster input on mobile. An idea for a feature I guess. An optional automatic and optionally encrypted one way sync to Google drive would be nice too.",

Another limitation is that you need to go to settings to edit tags. It'd be nice to have a shortcut button on the main screen. Nevertheless, overall - a solid 5/5",

My only feedback would be this: I'd love to see the dates under bar charts in the respective view of the analytics tab. So that I can not only see the trend, but also corelate it with days of the week, etc. It doesn't seem to be a difficult feature to implement, but would increase the usability of this view a lot! Anyways, thank you so much for this app!",

If you're looking for the easiest way to track time, then this is the app: - starting new timers takes less than a second - multiple timers at the same time are no problem - editing timers is quick and simple, you also see any time you haven't tracked which you can easily fill after the fact - all the data belongs to you - it has widgets which do exactly what they should do - you've got a large selection of icons for your tasks - the UI is simple and intuitive. Thank you for creating such an amazing tool.",
