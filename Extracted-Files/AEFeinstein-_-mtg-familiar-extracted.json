The other little tools that come with it are handy as well, like the dice and coin flip feature and saving a wish list. I can't recall ever having any problems. I love how you can sort by power, toughness and CMC. Searching by card text is wonderful. Card images look great too. I wish you could choose to swipe through your search results in either up/down or left/right. But that's just wishful thinking.",

Most cards have pricing and rulings (some don't but they are far and few between), and the pricing is usually pretty accurate. Life and mana counters are a plus! The deck builder is the best part of this app. Being able to build a deck and look at the cards you're adding for price and card text is amazing. Only thing I noticed does not work is the card camera. Other than that everything is good and worth the free app!",

The second thing is the \noption to search for the set of the card instead of looking for it in a \nlist in card trades, for example if i wanna trade basic lands in nomal sets \nthey worth nothing but if i want to trade for unhinged lands i need to \nscroll down a huge list of lands and search for unhinged, even if it will \nbe ordered alpha bethicly it will be easier.
