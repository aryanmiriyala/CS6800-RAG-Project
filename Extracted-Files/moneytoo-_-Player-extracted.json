At least it didn't scan and index my whole phone like many other video player apps that I immediately uninstalled. That's why you get 4 stars and they get 1 star. But I want a basic player app like that that I can autoplay all the videos from one folder that I manually select. And create playlists. That's why 4 instead of 5 stars - too basic to the point of unneeded.",

CONS: It's soo very basic that you can't adjust anything else, scans video with native file manager & no support to use 3rd party manager, screen lock button forces the app to portrait mode that other buttons went out of bounds, finally it doesn't have contrast adjustment. Overall if you wanted an extremely minimal video player, there you have it. But I'll pass on this one.",
