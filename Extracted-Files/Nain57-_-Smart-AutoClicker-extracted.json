I am using this for RuneScape and the bot detection in the game is pretty good, I'd love to adjust the offset of the click and the random range of waiting periods. It would also be nice to have color identification but not super important. Last feature that would be nice is being able to make the image detection condition smaller, it only looks like it can't be resized much",

I've been using it since pre-release as I didn't find anything in the app store that was as good as this and it has improved since then. It may take a bit of experemation and trial and error to get it to do as you want in complicated situations but it is worth the effort given how powerful it can be. The debug feature can be helpful in these situations. It does lack instructions but you'll work it out.",
