As others have stated, I do not reliably get notifications for either chats, or calls. Also had the grant access error that another poster described, and I am not able to send/receive voice or video when either of the connecting clients are outside my LAN. The \"grant access\" problem was a server setup issue that I fixed by modifying the server's config.php. I'm guessing the voice/video issue is also a server setup issue, but I have not figured it out yet. I am very excited about the nextcloud talk feature, and while annoyed at my ability to get the server configured, I don't want to give a low rating on this app for those issues. I am hoping though, that the app notification issues can be ironed out in the near term.",

No attachments from your phone (been \"in development\" for years now). Voice calls are sketchy, and randomly disconnect or are poor quality. Social interactions like GIFs aren't supported. Federation is not supported (another \"in development\" feature). This app is a wasted opportunity. I WANTED this to be good...",

Biggest thing preventing me from using it is unable to send locally stored files (photos videos etc) - can only send files stored in the cloud. Also would be nice to be able to respond directly from notification shade. Keeps getting better from what I can see. Keep it up with matching features for other alternatives (telegram) and I will switch.",
