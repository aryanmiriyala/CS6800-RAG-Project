So thank you for producing an app that at least *works*! That said, I can see it still has a fair bit of work ahead of it, but I look forward to it. I think there's considerable potential here. Load times are a bit slow for me, but I have that same issue with the core Cookbook app, so that might not be the fault of this app. The feature I miss most right now is the Markdown support in the recipe description; I use that extensively to provide additional data and cross-reference to other recipes/categories/etc. However, I'm sure that will be added eventually.",

That would be a cool feature. Would also be cool to create recipes via the app, in the same way as one can do it via the URL import. That would be cool. Don't know how much effort, and I also would say its a \"nice-to-have\" feature. Me and my girlfriend were looking for a way to store and order our recipes besides sharing and searching them in Whatsapp. W e will start with your app and the Nextcloud Cookbook and see how this works out.
