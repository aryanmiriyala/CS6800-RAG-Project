It offers detailed performance analysis in the form of graphs and shot grouping, allows for various targets, lets you save different equipment sets so you can compare how they shoot, add weather conditions, and more. The only things I would change about this app would be the addition of a few more target styles, and the ability to input custom distances, as there are many people who shoot at odd yardages, such as 15 and 25 yards. I have a slight issue with the app crashing after taking a photo of the target, but I believe that may be due to my phone's low memory. All in all, an amazing app!",

You can improve your shooting, fine tune your equipment, and adjust your sight scope much better and precise. Using this application correctly makes your training sessions double efficiency.

One thing i would love to see though would be an option to set distances ( simillar to arrow selection ) if your ranges are unkown and for tracking purposes be able to see groupings by range. Maybe seperate colored circles around the two farthest shots for each range ? Other than that amazing app keep up the good work. Oh and a port to IOS.  Update: Noticed the new grouping features in the most recent update while practicing on 115 targets. Amazing job! The choices for grouping worked perfectly to show exactly what was needed to help improve my shots! Cant wait for the next update. One thing that we noticed was it would be helpful to be able to flip the 3D targets as not all targets face the same direction.",

                "content": "Very good app.    I like the way of selecting bow and arrow combinations, as it makes it easy to track the parameters of a round. This is useful if you shoot different bow and arrow combinations.    However it should also have the possibility to input weather and location in the same way.    scoring screen is a little bit difficult to use at first, but gets better with use. I prefer the zoomable screen in \"archery scorer lite\" which is pretty much perfect for entering arrow positions (if you have a good score level, you can zoom in to just the red/yellow rings... we dont need the black and white very often).  Statistics are a bit strange - especially if you change bows from time to time.  Scoreboard is too small to read.  but still a good and useful app",
