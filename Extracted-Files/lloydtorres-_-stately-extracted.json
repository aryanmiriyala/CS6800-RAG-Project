I was a bit disappointed by the lack of ability to use nation settings in the app. I also found that regional message boards, while tidy, were not prominently featured, and lacked national flags. There is also no forum client or access to the \"Challenge\" page or dispatches. Overall, nothing too problematic, just features that would make this app more compete.  If the creator adds a forum client (which I'm sure is difficult, but it's something I'd love to see) and dispatches, I would consider this app worth five stars and even, perhaps, worth a (99¢) purchase.",
