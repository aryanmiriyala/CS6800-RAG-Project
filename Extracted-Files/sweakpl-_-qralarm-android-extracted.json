My only Qualms with the app is the lack of scheduling cause you have to manually set the alarm which is an inconvenience and my cause people to forgot to set their alarm.",

It's a giant black barcode on white copy paper....I turn all the lights on in my apartment, make sure its on a flat surface, all the rest... it still wont pick it up. My regular camera will, but scanning it that way wont shut off the alarm. Also, the option to use a local sound file as the alarm doesn't work either.",

Did the app not scan the code even if the code was more distant from the camera (1-2 meters)?, 2. When trying to set custom sound, did the app redirect You to the file picker screen? If so, what format was the selected audio file (mp3, wav etc.)?",
