Only one issue for me: There is the option for a dark theme UI, which I prefer. This works well when using translation dictionaries. However, when using the single language dictionaries, in my case English (I tried with French and saw the same result), the content displayed when you look up the definition of a word is displayed as black text on white background. This is very blinding when used in dark lighting because of the sudden switch from dark theme to a blinding bright white light in your face. I would love a consistent theme throughout.",
