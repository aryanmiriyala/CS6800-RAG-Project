The only feature I could think of to request would be an offline shopping mode. I created a shopping list on the server and it populated to my Android, but when I leave my local network, the app indicates \"Offline\". It would be very handy to be able to work from the list and enter items as \"Done\" or, better yet, \"Purchased\" so the price could be entered at the store. Then, when back on my network and connected to the server, the current price would be included in the upload.",

The items are synced with an offline database and you should be able to go offline, open the lists and mark items as done as usual. The changes are then synced with the server when you're back online.",
