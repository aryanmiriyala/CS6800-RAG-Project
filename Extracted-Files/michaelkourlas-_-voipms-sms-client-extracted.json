My only grief is mainly caused by the 160 character limit set by voip.ms but can be (slightly) mitigated with this app. When my message gets chopped up into separate SMS messages, the order they are sent is sometimes wrong. Is this something this app could fix by having a time delay between \"chopped\" messages? Also - a secondary feature that would be nice is that it does not \"chop\" a word in the middle, but rather go back to the last \"space\" so that the messages are easier to read. Those two features would turn this into a 5 start perfect app in my opinion!",

Also may I suggest contacting the textra developer and maybe integrating with their app or some kind of a team up. They have a tonne of great features.
