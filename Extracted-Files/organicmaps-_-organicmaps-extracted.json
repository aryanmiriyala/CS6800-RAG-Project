Edit: Dev responded immediately & advised me to long tap on objects for info. Genius! Thank you! 😁 Upgraded to 5*",

Organic Maps stores the bookmarks in an inaccessible folder (you need to root your device to have the access). The only way to backup this user data is to use a Google service, which is not what I want, or exporting the bookmarks manually, and individually for each bookmark list. Unfortunately, all the user data is also removed if you uninstall the application. The latest update caused the app to become unable to start, so, having no other option, I reinstalled it. This removed all the bookmarks. In maps.me, an app I migrated from, the bookmark files are easily accessible locally and every time you add some places to your bookmarks the bookmark files are updated. Also, all the user files are kept intact if you are forced to reinstall the application. In these aspects, Organic Maps seems like a beta still, when compared with maps.me.",

We had no network connection most of the time and with everything covered in snow Organic Maps was our only hope to find the trail and get home safe. Misfortunes never come singly as they say, so in addition to snow, wind, coldness, and the famous Swedish winter darkness my phone battery was about to run out. To save the battery I switched into flight mode - Organic Maps kept working flawlessly. Organic Maps had enough details for us to follow the trail precisely using GPS. We could not see the trail because of the snow but we could follow it using GPS - so good OpenStreetMap data is. Compare how \"Fulufjället nationalpark\" looks like in Google Maps vs OpenStreetMap and you will see what I am talking about. So yeah, if you plan to visit a remote region without getting lost in a dangerous situation then I can totally recommend Organic Maps. It served us well when our wellbeing depended on it.",

It downloads maps by itself _onto SD card_, the maps are pretty detailed with a lots of labels and infos, buildings are present as 3D-models, although crude, which eases the orientation. I that the app shows height profile while calculating a route for bicycle. On the flip side is that the maps are low-contrast, which makes observation in the daylight difficult. Road surface marking is barely present.",
